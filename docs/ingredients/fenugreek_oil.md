- **Vasodilation & Anti-Inflammatory:**  
  Flavonoids and trigonelline promote scalp blood circulation and reduce inflammation.
- **Antifungal & Bactericidal:**  
  Demonstrates fungicidal effects against various strains and exhibits bactericidal activity against pathogens such as *E. coli*, *S. typhi*, and *S. aureus*.
