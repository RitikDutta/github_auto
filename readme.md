# GitHub Auto - Voice-Powered Research Logging Assistant

GitHub Auto is an AI agent built with LangGraph designed to streamline the process of logging research data (experiments, formulations, results, etc.) into a GitHub repository using voice commands. It aims to reduce the friction of manual Git operations, allowing researchers to focus more on their lab work.

## Motivation

Conducting research, particularly in fields like chemistry, involves frequent updates to logs, protocols, and results. While using Git/GitHub for version control and centralized logging is beneficial, the repetitive cycle of:

1.  Manually creating/navigating to the correct file.
2.  Ensuring consistent formatting (especially for templated logs like formulations or tests).
3.  Writing a meaningful commit message.
4.  Staging, committing, and pushing the changes.

...can be time-consuming and interrupt the flow of experimental work. This project was born out of the need to automate this Git housekeeping via a more natural interface.

## Features

*   **Voice-Controlled:** Interact with your research repository using spoken commands.
*   **Context-Aware File Creation:** Tell the agent *what* you want to log (e.g., "a new formulation"), and it intelligently determines the likely location and can use existing files as templates for consistent formatting.
*   **File & Repository Interaction:**
    *   List files/directories within the repository.
    *   Display the contents of specific files.
*   **Content Modification:** Update existing log files with new data or corrections via voice command.
*   **Automated Git Workflow:** Automatically handles `git add`, `git commit` (with a generated relevant message), and `git push` after successful file operations.

## How It Works

GitHub Auto operates as a stateful agent orchestrated by LangGraph:

1.  **Input:** User issues a voice command.
2.  **Speech-to-Text (STT):** The audio command is transcribed into text.
3.  **Intent Recognition (LLM):** A Large Language Model interprets the text command to understand the user's goal (e.g., create file, update file, list files) and extracts necessary parameters (filename, content, directory).
4.  **Tool Execution:** Based on the intent, the LangGraph agent invokes the appropriate tool:
    *   **File System Tools:** Interact with the local repository clone (list files, read files, write/create files). These tools incorporate logic for template usage and directory inference.
    *   **Git Tools:** Execute Git commands (`add`, `commit`, `push`) via system calls or a Git library.
5.  **Commit Message Generation (LLM):** For file creation/updates, the LLM generates a concise and relevant commit message based on the action performed.
6.  **Git Workflow Automation:** The agent sequences the necessary Git commands to commit and push the changes to the remote repository.

LangGraph manages the state transitions and ensures the correct sequence of operations (e.g., file modification must happen before commit).

## Technology Stack

*   **Agent Framework:** [LangGraph](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph/)
*   **Language Models:** Underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) for NLU and generation (e.g., OpenAI GPT series, Anthropic Claude, local models via Ollama, etc. - *specify which you use if desired*)
*   **Speech-to-Text:** An STT engine/service (e.g., OpenAI Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text, vosk - *specify which you use if desired*)
*   **Git Integration:** Standard Git command-line interface or a Python library (e.g., `GitPython`).
*   **Core Language:** Python

## Example Usage

*(Note: These are conceptual examples of voice commands)*

*   `"GitHub Auto, create a new formulation log named 'FX-105' based on the standard template."`
    *   *Expected Action:* Creates `formulations/FX-105.md` (assuming `formulations/` is the target dir and a template exists), commits with message like "Create formulation log FX-105", pushes.
*   `"GitHub Auto, add observation 'Slight temperature increase noted at 1 hour' to experiment log 'EXP-Beta-Run3.log'."`
    *   *Expected Action:* Appends/updates the specified file, commits with message like "Update observations for EXP-Beta-Run3", pushes.
*   `"GitHub Auto, show me the contents of 'protocols/safety_check.md'."`
    *   *Expected Action:* Displays the content of the requested file to the user (e.g., via console output or synthesized speech).
*   `"GitHub Auto, list all files in the 'test_results/series_alpha' directory."`
    *   *Expected Action:* Lists the files within that specific directory.

## Getting Started

*(This section assumes the project might be shared or needs setup instructions later. Adjust as needed for personal use.)*

**Prerequisites:**

*   Python (specify version, e.g., 3.10+)
*   Git installed and configured on your system.
*   Access to the required LLM (e.g., API Key for OpenAI/Anthropic, or a running local LLM server).
*   Access to the required STT service/library.
*   A GitHub repository cloned locally that you want to manage.

**Installation:**

1.  Clone this repository (if applicable):
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd github-auto
    ```
2.  Set up a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Configure environment variables (e.g., API keys, path to your local research repository) - typically in a `.env` file. See `.env.example` if provided.

**Running the Agent:**

```bash
python main.py # Or however your main script is invoked


Follow the prompts or start speaking commands once the agent indicates it's ready.

Current Status & Future Work

Status: [e.g., Alpha, Beta, Personal Use] - Functional for core features described above.

Potential Future Enhancements:

More robust error handling and user feedback.

Support for more complex Git operations (branching, merging - potentially dangerous via voice?).

Visual feedback interface (optional).

Handling larger file updates or more complex structural changes.

Direct interaction with GitHub Issues or Projects.
